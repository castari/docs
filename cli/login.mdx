# cast login

Authenticate with Castari via browser-based OAuth.

## Usage

```bash
cast login
```

## What Happens

1. Opens your default browser to Castari login page
2. You sign in (or create an account)
3. Browser redirects back, CLI captures the token
4. Credentials saved to `~/.castari/credentials.json`

## Output

```
Opening browser to authenticate...
✓ Logged in as you@example.com
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--no-browser` | Print login URL instead of opening browser |

### Headless Authentication

For CI/CD or headless environments:

```bash
cast login --no-browser
```

This prints the URL for manual authentication.

<Tip>
For automated environments, use an API key instead of OAuth. See [Environment Variables](/cli/overview#environment-variables).
