# Claude Code Plugin

The Castari plugin for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) lets you deploy agents without leaving your editor. Type `/castari-deploy` and the skill handles CLI installation, authentication, project scaffolding, and deployment — all in one flow.

<Info>
**View on skills.sh:** [skills.sh/castari/cli](https://skills.sh/castari/cli)

## Install the Plugin

```bash
npx skills add castari/cli
```

This installs the Castari plugin into your Claude Code environment. Once installed, the `/castari-deploy` skill is available in any project.

## Using `/castari-deploy`

Type `/castari-deploy` in Claude Code (or ask Claude to "deploy to Castari") and the skill walks through the full deployment flow:

### Step 1: CLI Check

The skill checks if the Castari CLI is installed by running `cast --version`. If not found, it installs the CLI globally via npm.

### Step 2: Authentication

Runs `cast whoami` to check if you're logged in. If not, it triggers `cast login` which opens your browser for Clerk OAuth authentication.

### Step 3: Project Configuration

Looks for `castari.json` in your project root. If one exists, the skill confirms its configuration with you. If not, it:

- Detects your entrypoint file (e.g., `src/index.ts`, `index.js`)
- Asks you for an agent name
- Generates a `castari.json` manifest

### Step 4: Deploy

Runs `cast deploy` to package your project and deploy it to an isolated cloud sandbox.

### Step 5: Verification

Shows you a summary of the deployment — agent name, status, and sandbox ID.

### Step 6: Testing

Offers to test the deployed agent by running `cast invoke` with a prompt you provide.

## Trigger Phrases

The skill activates when you ask Claude to:

- "deploy to Castari"
- "deploy my agent"
- "castari deploy"
- "push agent to Castari"
- "ship my agent"
- "set up Castari"

Or any variation of deploying an agent to Castari.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18 or higher
- A [Castari account](https://app.castari.com) (free to sign up)
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) installed
