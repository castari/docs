# Quick Start

Deploy your first Claude agent in under 5 minutes.

<Info>
**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+ and npm installed.
</Info>

<Steps>

<Step title="Install the CLI">

```bash
npm install -g @castari/cli
```

Verify installation:

```bash
cast --version
```

</Step>

<Step title="Login to Castari">

```bash
cast login
```

This opens your browser to authenticate. Once complete, you'll see:

```
✓ Logged in as you@example.com
```

</Step>

<Step title="Create your first agent">

```bash
cast init my-agent
```

Select the `default` template when prompted. This creates a coding agent with file and bash tools.

```
? Select a template:
❯ default — Coding agent with file and bash tools (like Claude Code)
  research-agent — Deep research with web search and document synthesis
  support-agent — Customer support with ticket handling and escalation
  mcp-tools — Agent with example MCP server integration

✓ Created my-agent/ from default template
✓ Installed dependencies
```

</Step>

<Step title="Deploy your agent">

```bash
cd my-agent
cast deploy
```

Wait for deployment to complete:

```
⠋ Deploying my-agent...
✓ Agent 'my-agent' deployed!
```

</Step>

<Step title="Invoke your agent">

```bash
cast invoke my-agent "What files are in the current directory?"
```

Your agent responds:

```
The current directory contains:
- src/index.ts
- package.json
- castari.json
- CLAUDE.md
- README.md
```

</Step>

</Steps>
